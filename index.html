                        (Song Lyrics)<br>
                        This is the greatest and best song in the world<br>
                        Tribute<br>
                        A long time ago<br>
                        Me and my brother Kyle, here<br>
                        We was hitchhiking down<br>
                        A long and lonesome road<br>
                        <br>
                        All of a sudden<br>
                        There shined a shiny demon<br>
                        In the middle of the road<br>
                        And he said:<br>
                        "Play the best song in the world<br>
                        Or I'll eat your soul" (Soul)<br>
                        <br>
                        Well, me and Kyle<br>
                        We looked at each other<br>
                        And we each said:<br>
                        "Okay"<br>
                        <br>
                        And we played the first thing that came to our heads<br>
                        Just so happened to be<br>
                        The best song in the world<br>
                        It was the best song in the world!<br>
                        <br>
                        Look into my eyes and it's easy to see<br>
                        One and one make two<br>
                        Two and one make three<br>
                        It was destiny<br>
                        <br>
                        Once every hundred-thousand years or so<br>
                        Where the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow<br>
                        And the grass doth grow<br>
                        <br>
                        Needless to say<br>
                        The beast was stunned<br>
                        Whip crack wit'ya swampy tail<br>
                        And the beast was done<br>
                        He asked us:<br>
                        "(snort) Be you angels?"<br>
                        And we said:<br>
                        "NAY! We are but men, ROCK!"<br>
                        aaaahetc<br>
                        <br>
                        This is not<br>
                        The greatest song in the world, no<br>
                        This is just a tribute<br>
                        Couldn't remember<br>
                        The greatest song in the world, no (no!)<br>
                        This is a tribute!!<br>
                        Oh oh!!!<br>
                        <br>
                        To the greatest song in the world oh lordy<br>
                        It was the greatest song in the world allright<br>
                        This is just the best motherfuckin song<br>
                        To the greatest song in the world<br>
                        [skattin]<br>
                        <br>
                        Oh mama, Lucifer!<br>
                        And the peculiar thing is this, my friend<br>
                        The song we sang on that fateful night <br>
                        it didn't actually sound anything like this song<br>
                        <br>
                        This is just a tribute<br>
                        You've gotta believe me<br>
                        And I wish you were there<br>
                        It's just a matter of opinion<br>
                        Ah, fuck!<br>
                        <br>
                        Good god! God lovin'!<br>
                        I'm so surprised<br>
                        To find you can't stop em!<br>
                        Rich motherfucker<br>
                        allright (X3)<br>
